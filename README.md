## About
The repository contains a program with a sorting algorithm which sorts data on a stack. The aim is to achieve the smallest number of moves for sorting
the respective numbers of the stack (given as arguments to the program) whereby the sorting instruction are limited by the subject. The project introduced
oneself to the concept of **single linked lists** in c programming and different sorting algorithms.

## Program
The code of the push_swap program makes use of the several modificaton possibilities of single linked lists in order to sort the stack of numbers.
The executable takes an undefined amount of arguments which have to be whole numbers (both positive and negative possible), each number in the range
of min - max int. 

## Requirements
-`gcc` compiler
with `<fcntl.h>` and `<stdio.h>` 

## Instructions

### 1. Compiling the program

To compile a program with the function, create a main.c file (see example in 2.)  within the repo folder and run:

```
$ gcc get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c main.c 
```

### 2. Using it in your code (basic example)

To use the function, include the header path in your main.c file (given all files are in the same folder):
```
#include "get_next_line.h"
```
Also include a file (e.g. test.txt) with some content in the folder.
Example of main.c (reads first 10 lines of the given test.txt file):
```
int	main(void)
{
	int		fd;
	char	*line;
	int		i;

	i = 0;
	fd = open("test.txt", O_RDONLY);
	if (fd < 0)
	{
		perror("Error opening file");
		return (1);
	}
	while (i < 10)
	{
		line = get_next_line(fd);
		printf("%s", line);
		free(line);
		i++;
	}
	close(fd);
	return (0);
}
```
Another main.c example for reading straight from the stdin of the terminal:
```
int	main(void)
{
	char	*line;
	int		i;

	i = 0;
	while (i < 10)
	{
		line = get_next_line(STDIN_FILENO);
		printf("%s", line);
		free(line);
		i++;
	}
	return (0);
}
```
### 3. Bonus Part
Bonus files are to be compiled in the same way as the basic files described above. The header
needs to be changed to:
```
#include "get_next_line_bonus.h"
```
This version of the get_next_line function is able to process multiple filedescriptors at once.
A respective main.c file could look as follows:
```
#include <fcntl.h> 
#include <stdio.h> 
#include "get_next_line_bonus.h"

int	main(void)
{
	int		fd;
	int		fd2;
	char	*line;
	char	*line2;
	int		i;

	i = 0;
	fd = open("test.txt", O_RDONLY);
	fd2 = open("test_2.txt", O_RDONLY);
	if (fd < 0 && fd2 < 0)
	{
		perror("Error opening file");
		return (1);
	}
	while (i < 10)
	{
		line = get_next_line(fd);
		line2 = get_next_line(fd2);
		printf("%s", line);
		printf("%s", line2);
		free(line);
		free(line2);
		i++;
	}
	close(fd);
	close(fd2);
	return (0);
}
```
## Testing
This library has been tested with [Francinette](https://github.com/xicodomingues/francinette).
